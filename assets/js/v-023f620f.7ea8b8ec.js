If you have a monitor that isnâ€™t 16:9, you may change the aspect ratio to match it in Cemu.</p></details><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Resolution</summary><p>If you have a more powerful GPU, you may be able to change the resolution to a higher value, e.g. 1080p, 1440p (2K) or 2160p (4K).</p><p>For higher resolutions, consider using the Vulkan rendering API for increased performance. For lower resolution monitors, you can also set your resolution to a higher value for a higher quality anti-aliasing effect, however this is very computationally expensive.</p><p>Run the game with different resolutions to see which works best for you.</p></details><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Anti-Aliasing</summary><p>BOTW has anti-aliasing enabled by default. If you would like to use NVIDIA&#39;s implementation, or disable it entirely, you can switch to that here. We recommend leaving this at the default setting.</p></details><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Shadows</summary><p>This setting changes the resolution of the shadows. Increasing it makes shadows sharper and more accurate, while decreasing it can gain performance while sacrificing quality.</p><p>Setting this to 400% may cause some instabilities so we recommend a maximum of 300%.</p></details><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Shadow Draw Distance</summary><p>This setting changes the draw distance of the shadows. Increasing it makes shadows render further away, but can make shadows blurrier.</p><p>We recommend setting to &quot;Very High&quot; to increase draw distance without sacrificing too much shadow detail.</p></details><hr><p>Once understanding what each setting does, we recommend you configure your own options.
