With OpenGL and Vulkan, the shaderCache will build as you play and will eventually become nearly unnoticable. As mentioned, Vulkan also requires a pipelineCache - this cache type will build quickly and have minor stutter. Keep in mind that it has to be rebuilt from scratch every time you update your GPU driver or Cemu as a sideeffect from becoming invalidated when either of these change.</p><p>To alleviate gameplay stalls caused by shader and pipeline building, read <a href="#async-shader-compile">Async Shader Compile</a> further below.</p><h3 id="can-i-disable-preload-or-download-shaderscaches" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#can-i-disable-preload-or-download-shaderscaches" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Can I disable, preload, or download shadersCaches?</h3><p>If you simply want to turn off the notification that tells you they are being made, you can do this in <code>Options</code> -&gt; <code>General settings</code> -&gt; <code>Overlay</code>.</p><p>On the contrary, no, you cannot magically create a cache before playing the game nor can you disable Shader or Pipelines to prevent stalling. Shaders and Pipelines are what allow your games to work on your GPU. No Shaders or Pipelines = No game - the emulator becomes a black square with only some music.</p><p>If you happen to get impatient and think downloading a cache is a good idea, please think again. Not only are caches from outside sources not reliable due to inconsistencies between game versions, data corruption, GPU vendors, etc - but due to these, external caches often cause severe graphical problems, performance drops, and otherwise inexplainable crashes. Cache distribution is also illegal by technicality, as they contain copyrighted data from within the games themselves.</p><p>Only use your own cache and Async Shader Compile. If you have tried to download one, please remove the cache before asking for assistance.</p><h3 id="async-shader-compile" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#async-shader-compile" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Async Shader Compile</h3><p>This feature is only available for GPUs with drivers that support Vulkan 1.2 or newer; not Vulkan 1.1!</p><p>Users that fit this criteria should navigate to Cemu&#39;s <code>Options</code> -&gt; <code>General settings</code> -&gt; <code>Graphics</code> section, then enable the <code>Async shader compile</code> feature.

Not all shaders and pipelines can be created in this way and will still result in some minor stalling.</p><p>Newer Intel iGPUs support this feature as long as they both support Vulkan 1.2 and are using the latest available drivers.
